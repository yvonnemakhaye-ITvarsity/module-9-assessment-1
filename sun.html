                <p class="intro">
                    The sun or Sol,is the star at the centre of our solar system and is responsiblefor the earth's climate and weather.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. The avarage radius of the Sun is 695, 508 kmm(109.2 x thhat of the Earth) of which 20-25% is the core.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earth then around 960, 000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths squished inside with no wasted space then around 1, 3000, 000 would fit inside. The Sun's surface area is 11,999 times that of the Earth's.
